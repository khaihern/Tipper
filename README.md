## About

Tipper is a simple and easy to use tip calculator to help users calculate tips and split costs among multiple parties. This Tipper version is an upgrade from [Version 1](https://tip-calculator-v1--khai_hernhern.repl.co/) with completely new designs and colors. 

### What are the features?

1. A slider can be used so there is no need to type out the amount
2. 5 built in tip percentages options allows for faster calculations 
3. Split the cost among multiple parties
4. All calculations can be done without the need to use a keypad
5. Calculator can be used offline without an internet connection after the web app is downloaded

## How to get it?

Tipper can be accessed at the url: https://kh-tipper.netlify.app

After a few seconds, there will be a pop-up allowing you to download the web app to your device should you choose to.

## How and why I built this web app?

I built this web app using ReactJS and this project was also bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I built this app as a way to practice my newly learned ReactJS skills after 2 weeks into learning the framework. This app gave me an opportunity to explore many ReactJS features (hooks, reducers, contexts, etc.), Service Worker, and how to build a Progressive Web App.
